#Our dataset contains 20 columns, most of which are stored as strings. There are a few columns with null values, but no columns have more than ~20% null values. There are some columns that contain dates stored as strings.
We'll start by cleaning the column names to make the data easier to work with.

autos.columns

#We'll make a few changes here:
Change the columns from camelcase to snakecase.
Change a few wordings to more accurately describe the columns.

autos.columns = ['date_crawled', 'name', 'seller', 'offer_type', 'price', 'ab_test',

Our initial observations:
There are a number of text columns where all (or nearly all) of the values are the same:
seller
offer_type
The num_photos column looks odd, we'll need to investigate this further.


autos["num_photos"].value_counts()

#It looks like the num_photos column has 0 for every column. We'll drop this column, plus the other two we noted as mostly one value.


autos = autos.drop(["num_photos", "seller", "offer_type"], axis=1)

#There are two columns, price and auto, which are numeric values with extra characters being stored as text. We'll clean and convert these.


autos["price"] = (autos["price"]
                          .str.replace("$","")

                             .str.replace("km","")
                             .str.replace(",","")
                             .astype(int)
                             )
autos.rename({"odometer": "odometer_km"}, axis=1, inplace=True)

#Exploring Odometer and Price

autos["odometer_km"].value_counts()

We can see that the values in this field are rounded, which might indicate that sellers had to choose from pre-set options for this field. Additionally, there are more high mileage than low mileage vehicles.

#Exploring the date columns
There are a number of columns with date information:

-date_crawled
-registration_month
-registration_year
-ad_created
-last_seen

autos[['date_crawled','ad_created','last_seen']][0:5]

(autos["date_crawled"]
        .str[:10]
        .value_counts(normalize=True, dropna=False)
        .sort_index()
        )
autos["price"].head()

(autos["date_crawled"]
        .str[:10]
        .value_counts(normalize=True, dropna=False)
        .sort_values()
        )

(autos["last_seen"]
        .str[:10]
        .value_counts(normalize=True, dropna=False)
        .sort_index()

        .str[:10]
        .value_counts(normalize=True, dropna=False)
        .sort_index()
        )

There is a large variety of ad created dates. Most fall within 1-2 months of the listing date, but a few are quite old, with the oldest at around 9 months.


autos["registration_year"].describe()

Dealing with Incorrect Registration Year Data

One option is to remove the listings with these values. Let's determine what percentage of our data has invalid values in this column:


(~autos["registration_year"].between(1900,2016)).sum() / autos.shape[0]

Given that this is less than 4% of our data, we will remove these rows.


# Many ways to select rows in a dataframe that fall within a value range for a column.
# Using `Series.between()` is one way.
autos = autos[autos["registration_year"].between(1900,2016)]
autos["registration_year"].value_counts(normalize=True).head(10)

It appears that most of the vehicles were first registered in the past 20 years.

Exploring Price by Brand

autos["brand"].value_counts(normalize=True)

brand_counts = autos["brand"].value_counts(normalize=True)
common_brands = brand_counts[brand_counts > .05].index
print(common_brands)

brand_mean_prices = {}

for brand in common_brands:
    brand_only = autos[autos["brand"] == brand]
    mean_price = brand_only["price"].mean()
    brand_mean_prices[brand] = int(mean_price)

brand_mean_prices

Exploring Mileage

bmp_series = pd.Series(brand_mean_prices)
pd.DataFrame(bmp_series, columns=["mean_price"])

brand_mean_mileage = {}

for brand in common_brands:
    brand_only = autos[autos["brand"] == brand]
    mean_mileage = brand_only["odometer_km"].mean()
    brand_mean_mileage[brand] = int(mean_mileage)

mean_mileage = pd.Series(brand_mean_mileage).sort_values(ascending=False)
mean_prices = pd.Series(brand_mean_prices).sort_values(ascending=False)

brand_info = pd.DataFrame(mean_mileage,columns=['mean_mileage'])
brand_info

brand_info["mean_price"] = mean_prices
brand_info

The range of car mileages does not vary as much as the prices do by brand, 
instead all falling within 10% for the top brands. 
There is a slight trend to the more expensive vehicles having higher mileage, 
with the less expensive vehicles having lower mileage.
